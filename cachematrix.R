## Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrixless
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit
## to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedlyã€‚
## This scripts contains a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## makeCacheMatrix  creates a special "matrix" object
## that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    inv <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        inv <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
    getinverse <- function() inv
    list(set = set, get = get,
    setinverse = setinverse,
    getinverse = getinverse)
}


## cacheSolve computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve
## the inverse from the cache.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    inv <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(inv)) {
        message("getting cached data.")
        return(inv)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    inv <- solve(data)
    x$setinverse(inv)
    inv
}
